                            <p> It dawned on me that most of my users streams transcode because they have set top streaming devices plugged directly into TVs. 99% of my videos contain only a 5.1 Dolby Digital stream (AC3). I figured out how to re-encode with both an AC3 and MP3 stream included in the same file, but I'm not really sure how PMC decides which stream to send to the client. Anyone know? (This might not be "meta" so apologies for the incorrect flair Hi, First post here, hopefully not the last. I live in a very remote area up north and have to cope with terribly slow internet bandwidth. I can reach 300 kb/s on good days, but that's pretty much the max i'll get. The thing is, I've acquired a pretty nice collection of media during my vacation where the internet was lightning fast and I'm looking for a way to play them here. The files, let's call them "home videos", are of many different file types (mkv, avi, mp4, etc.), quality (1080p Hi, I've read all the posts, and I think it might be because of an update to the iOS app (according to this post (https://www.reddit.com/r/PleX/comments/6nodo9/plex_keeps_transcoding_hvec_to_chromacast_ultra/) the issue was the Android app which he downgraded, but I can't change the version of my iOS app, so that's not an option). I'm hoping it isn't, though. In the WebApp admin screen, I see transcoding video from HEVC to H264. I've updated my Plex Chromecast profile to the following:. System: Windows Server 2016 Plex Server 1.9.0.4252 w/ PlexPass I've recently switched back to Plex after using other solutions since 2011ish, most recently Emby. In Emby, I had my home theater tv working perfectly with my Panasonic Viera S60 via DLNA, after a significant amount of profile tweaking with one I found online. Now in Plex I have replaced the Viera 3D profile which it triggers, even though it isn't 3D, with one I found for the ST60. The original 3D profile transcoded audio unnecessar. 
I have a 4K TV with a recently bought Chromecast Ultra for which I use the Android Plex app to cast videos. Problem is the Plex server keeps transcoding the 4K HVEC media when I stream to the CCU. Here is what I see on the server: Info on stream ( Here is the Chromecast.xml on the server: gt lt?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?gt gt ltClient name="Chromecast"gt gt ltTranscodeTargetsgt gt ltVideoProfile protocol="h. I have some music that I pitched down in audacity to a 432 HZ frequency, but the PS4 refuses to recognize the files no matter what they are. AC3, AAC, MP3, no matter which format, it doesn't recognize them. Quicktime player does, VLC media player does, but the PS4 decided to be the odd device out in this situation. Do you guys know what's going. Some of you have noticed that I post "mic-only" videos of the acts in Melodifestivalen on Dailymotion, under the same username as here, and privately asked me how to do it, so this is for you, guys. If you don't know what I'm talking about, it's these (they might be taken down by SVT any day now, as usual, so hurry up): 1. SaRaha - Kizunguzungu ( 2. Swingfly feat. Helena Gutarra - You Carved Your Name (http://www.da. I cannot get any 5.1 streaming through either my ATV3 running PlexConnect or my PS3 using DLNA. I have verified that my receiver is not the issue because if I play a Bluray it plays 5.1 properly and I can even get 5.1 to play on my files on the PS3 if I use PS3 Media Server. I've have spent read about every forum I can find and cannot get it to work. I am running PMS 0.9.9.10 on a Mac Pro: Processor 3.7 GHz Intel Core i7 Memory 16 GB 1333 MHz DDR3 Graphics Intel HD Graphics 4600 1024 Softwa. The windows 10 apps used to transcode audio to ac3 when it was unsupported (DTS, DD True HD, ect.), but now the app is having everything converted to AAC 6ch and my reciever or soundblaster card doesn't support that. It used to work perfectly but somewhere in the recent updates something was changed. How can I set Plex to only ever transcode So my boss wants to use these VonHaus Nano 3.0 Media Players ( as a means to play video via USB stick on TVs at our booth at a conference coming up. I appear to be having an issue with videos I've had to pull from our YouTube channels (raw files lost during a merger) as videos I've started with from original mp4s don't seem to have this issue. I've been using AVC to convert all the videos to mp4 with the xvid codec for video.

Since ChromeOS is somewhat particular in what audio and video codecs it will play, I'm playing around with using FFmpeg to convert videos into Chromebook playable formats. (Not to mention issues of bitrates.) Anyway, I was wondering if maybe someone has some presets available for Chromebooks? (Please say yes—I'm not very good with this video conversion stuff.) Or is there some existing software for doing appropriate conversions that I'm not aware of? Also, since we're talking video playback. I had an old DVD which I copied to my hard drive and the DVD is long gone. Most video media I have is digital on one of my external hard drives, so I abandoned the idea of trying to recreate a DVD (btw, the DVD is out of print). This would have been a rather easy conversion except that the default audio track was in Finnish (dubbed). The movie is in English, but for whatever reason (maybe the DVD was for another region), "Audio Track 2" (non-default) is the regular English. If I tried 
What do you think about my HandBrake Transcoding settings? My goal is to create an universal 1080p Direct Play Medium to stream on Chromecast/Mobile/Fire TV etc. amp#x200B; Since I am pretty new to the plex universe I wonder if someone would like to share his setting with me or give me a hint on what I should change on mine. gtYou can export your presets with HandBrake. gt gt1. Presets gt Show Presets gt gt2. In the Presets Window gt Select your Preset gt Export. I'm posting (a long post) of my personal re-encode of another project here, hopefully someone will find this useful/interesting. If not, I still had fun with it, because I still have love for this show :) I'm including my full notes from the project here, in addition to some useful information at the bottom. amp#x200B; TLDR: A re-encode of a HD upconvert of Babylon 5 seasons 01-05, now includes TV movies and DVD Audio pack.

The one major failing of most video digitisation is that the bonus material gets kicked to the curb. this idea may be too niche for a full torrent tracker setup, but are there already sites (or hell, a tracker I'm not familiar with) that focus on dvd/ bluray commentary tracks? Having the ability to find tracks not available on other releases or in stores/online could be one heck of an archive project. All that lost info about directors and actors states of mind, or movie and tv details.

I have a script for HandBrakeCLI that is set to copy all audio tracks in english, but it recently broke and now output files have no audio at all. I know the source has english audio and it is labelled properly when pulling it up in the handbrake gui, but for some reason when running any files through the HandBrakeCLI it outputs with no audio. It worked without issues for close to a year up until earlier this month. I've tried it on multiple files and just recently noticed this was happening.

This online converter could help users convert any video and audio files for free (https://www.apeaksoft.com/free-online-video-converter/). It support various audio files such as MP3/AAC/AC3/WMA/WAV and video files such as FLV/WMV/WEBM/VOB/MPG/3GP, etc. Convert Video to GIF Online is also available. Every users can have a try and tell me about your experience！ Wish to hear what do you think about this software. I've been using Handbrake for years and recently upgraded from 1.1 to 1.2.2. Since the upgrade, I've been having issues with my encodes. I'm going from MKV to MP4 and one or two files will encode ok. but then they will start out with a negative time remaining or run but then only complete a small amount of the encode before going to a new one (a file that would be usually 1.2GB will then be only 450MB and only have a black screen and audio). I did some reading and saw that subtitles. ltbrgtltbrgtlta href="http://www.spsasosgsmost.cz/?s=%ED%94%BC%ED%8C%8C%EC%98%A8%EB%9D%BC%EC%9D%B83%EC%B9%9C%EA%B5%AC%EB%9E%91%e3%80%90+88azt.com+%e3%80%91%EA%B5%89%EA%B5%89%EA%B3%B0%EC%8B%A0%EC%8B%9C%EB%82%B4%ED%8B%B0+%EC%83%81%EC%88%98+%EC%89%90%EB%AF%B8%EB%85%B8+%ED%95%9C%EA%B5%AD%EC%B6%9C%ED%8C%90%EC%9D%B8%ED%9A%8C%EC%9D%98+%EB%82%A8%EB%B6%81%ED%99%94%ED%95%A9%ED%8F%AC%EC%8A%A4%ED%84%B0+%EA%B8%B0%EC%95%84%ED%83%80%EC%9D%B4%EA%B1%B0%EC%A6%88%EC%9A%94%EB%AF%B8%EC%9A%B0%EB%A6%AC%EC%9E. </p>
